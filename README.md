Biomedical image analysis plays a crucial role in the early and accurate diagnosis of diseases, significantly impacting patient outcomes. This study presents an innovative approach to biomedical image analysis by integrating machine learning techniques with a user-friendly web interface. 
The system takes input images uploaded through the web interface and processes them using advanced machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. The goal is to automate the detection of diseases from these images, enhancing the efficiency and precision of diagnosis. 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a specialized class of deep learning models designed for image analysis, are employed to learn and characterize disease-specific patterns. The proposed approach is evaluated using diverse biomedical images encompassing various diseases and conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the system's effectiveness, achieving high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in disease detection. The integration of machine learning with a web interface not only simplifies the diagnostic process but also enables remote consultations, making healthcare services more accessible and timely. 
In conclusion, this study presents a robust framework for automated biomedical image analysis, demonstrating the potential of machine learning and web technologies in revolutionizing healthcare diagnostics. 
The system's accuracy and user-friendly interface make it a valuable tool for healthcare professionals, contributing to early disease detection and improved patient care.
